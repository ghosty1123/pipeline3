# CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application. The pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, as well as provide notifications for failed builds or deployments.

## Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: Compiles the source code and generates build artifacts.
2. **Test**: Runs unit tests and performs code quality checks.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to a staging environment.
4. **Notification**: Sends notifications if any stage fails.

## Workflow File

The pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file. Hereâ€™s a summary of its contents:
